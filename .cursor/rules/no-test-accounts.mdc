# No Test Accounts Rule

## 🚫 NEVER Create Test Accounts

**CRITICAL**: Never create test accounts, dummy accounts, or placeholder accounts for content generation. Only use real, live accounts from the `account_profiles` table.

### ✅ Allowed Accounts
- Real accounts from `account_profiles` table only
- Accounts with complete profiles and strategies
- Verified accounts with `is_active: true`
- Accounts that have been scraped and contain real images/posts

### ❌ Forbidden Actions
- Creating test account profiles
- Using placeholder usernames like `test_account`, `demo_user`, `example_account`
- Generating content for non-existent accounts
- Creating dummy data for testing purposes
- Using accounts from general `accounts` table for content generation

### 🔍 How to Check for Real Accounts
1. Use [check-available-accounts.js](mdc:check-available-accounts.js) to see real accounts with images
2. Query `account_profiles` table for accounts with complete profiles
3. Only use accounts that appear in `account_profiles` with `is_active: true`
4. Verify accounts have real images, posts, and engagement data

### 📋 Account Selection Process
1. Run `node check-available-accounts.js` to see available accounts
2. Query `account_profiles` table for accounts with complete data
3. Choose from accounts with the highest image counts (e.g., accounts with 100+ images)
4. Use accounts like `3fashionicon3`, `miaslife_09`, `my.darling.g`, etc. from `account_profiles`
5. Never create new test accounts - only use existing real data from `account_profiles`

### 🧹 Cleanup Required
If you accidentally create test accounts:
1. Delete the test account profile from the `account_profiles` table
2. Remove any test scripts or files
3. Only use real accounts from `account_profiles` going forward

### 💡 Best Practices
- Always verify account exists in `account_profiles` table before generating content
- Use accounts with substantial image collections (50+ images minimum)
- Focus on accounts with good aesthetic variety and engagement
- Never create placeholder or dummy data for testing
- Only use `account_profiles` table for content generation, never `accounts` table
