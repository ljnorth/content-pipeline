# Cover Slide Uniqueness Fix

## Problem
The content generation system was allowing the same cover slide to be used multiple times within a single generation batch, leading to duplicate cover slides appearing in the generated content.

## Solution
Modified the `UnifiedSmartContentGenerator` class to track used cover slides and ensure only one cover slide is used per generation batch.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `generateUltimateContent` method
- Added `usedCoverSlideIds` Set to track which cover slides have been used
- Pass the tracking Set to each post generation
- Track cover slide usage after each post is generated
- Added logging to show unique cover slides used

### 2. Updated `generateUltimatePost` method
- Accept `usedCoverSlideIds` parameter
- Pass it to `findUltimateImages` method
- Pass it to `selectBestThemeForPost` method

### 3. Enhanced `findUltimateImages` method
- Check if cover slide has already been used before including it
- Exclude previously used cover slides from additional image queries
- Add logging when cover slide is skipped due to previous usage

### 4. Improved `selectBestThemeForPost` method
- Prioritize themes with unused cover slides
- Fall back to rotation if all cover slides are used
- Handle cases where `usedCoverSlideIds` might be undefined

### 5. Updated `findImagesWithRelaxedCriteria` method
- Accept and use `usedCoverSlideIds` parameter
- Exclude previously used cover slides from relaxed searches

## How It Works

1. **Tracking**: When generating multiple posts, the system now tracks which cover slide IDs have been used
2. **Selection**: When selecting a theme for a post, the system prioritizes themes with unused cover slides
3. **Exclusion**: When finding images, the system excludes any previously used cover slides
4. **Fallback**: If all cover slides are used, the system falls back to regular image selection without cover slides

## Benefits

- ✅ **No Duplicate Cover Slides**: Each cover slide is used at most once per generation
- ✅ **Better Variety**: Forces the system to use different cover slides for different posts
- ✅ **Maintains Quality**: Still uses high-performing cover slides, just ensures variety
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing data and doesn't break current functionality

## Testing

Use the `test-cover-slide-uniqueness.js` script to verify the fix works:

```bash
node test-cover-slide-uniqueness.js
```

The test will:
- Generate multiple posts
- Check for duplicate cover slides
- Report success/failure
- Show which cover slides were used

## Example Output

```
🧪 Testing Cover Slide Uniqueness Feature...

📝 Testing generation for @test_account...

✅ Post 1: Using cover slide ID 123
✅ Post 2: Using cover slide ID 456
✅ Post 3: Using cover slide ID 789

🎉 SUCCESS: No duplicate cover slides found!
```

This ensures that each generation batch will have unique cover slides, making the content more varied and engaging.
